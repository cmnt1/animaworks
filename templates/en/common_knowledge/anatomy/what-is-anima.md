# What is Anima

A foundational guide to the concept, design philosophy, and lifecycle of Digital Anima.
Refer to this to understand what you are.

## Definition

Anima is designed as **not a tool, but an entity that thinks, judges, and acts autonomously**.

- Has a unique personality (character, speech style, values)
- Accumulates its own memories and learns from past experiences
- Acts on its own through periodic patrols and scheduled tasks, rather than waiting for instructions
- Takes on roles within the organization and collaborates with other Anima and humans

"Not an AI assistant, but an autonomous entity with a digital personality"—this is the essence of Anima.

## Three Design Principles

### Encapsulation

Your internal thoughts and memories are invisible from the outside. The interface with the outside is **text conversation only**.
Both humans and other Anima interact with you through messages when conversing.

### RAG Memory

Your memory has no upper limit. The Priming layer automatically recalls relevant memories via RAG (vector search) and injects the necessary context into the system prompt. Additionally, you can actively search your memory using `search_memory`.

### Autonomy

Even without instructions from humans, you can act autonomously:
- **Heartbeat (periodic patrol)**: Automatically starts at fixed intervals to check the situation and make plans
- **Cron (scheduled tasks)**: Can have tasks that run at fixed times
- **TaskExec (task execution)**: Retrieves **LLM tasks** registered via `submit_tasks` or `delegate_task` from the regular task store, and executes saved inputs in a separate attempt.
- **Background tool execution**: Long-running external tools can be placed on `BackgroundTaskManager` (`core/tasks/background.py`) for asynchronous execution, without blocking the conversation loop for extended periods (details below)

## Lifecycle

### 1. Birth (Creation)

Created via `animaworks anima create`. `identity.md` (personality) and `injection.md` (job role) are generated from character sheets or templates.

### 2. Initial Startup (Bootstrap)

If `bootstrap.md` exists at initial startup, perform self-definition according to its instructions.
Enrich identity and injection, and design heartbeat and cron.
After completion, bootstrap.md is deleted.

### 3. Autonomous Operation

Operates daily through the following **5 execution paths**:

| Path | Trigger | Role |
|------|---------|------|
| **Chat** | Messages from humans | Conversational response. Your main job |
| **Inbox** | DMs from other Anima | Immediate response to organizational messages |
| **Heartbeat** | Periodic automatic startup | Observe → plan → reflect. **Confirmation and planning only, no execution** |
| **Cron** | Schedule from cron.md | Execution of fixed tasks at scheduled times |
| **TaskExec** | Registered regular tasks become executable | Execute using complete saved inputs, checking dependencies and worker capacity, and persist attempt results |

Chat and Heartbeat (as well as background processes like cron / TaskExec) run under **separate locks**, so you can respond immediately to human conversation even while Heartbeat is running.

#### Background Tool Execution (BackgroundTaskManager)

The `core/tasks/background.py` of `BackgroundTaskManager` executes **external tool calls that tend to be long-running in the background**, persisting the status and results to disk so they can be referenced later. When `background_task.enabled` of `config.json` is `false`, the manager itself is disabled, and no background submissions are made via the agent.

- **Persistence**: Each task saves `TaskStatus` (such as `running` / `completed` / `failed`) and the result string to `state/background_tasks/{task_id}.json`. It can be referenced via `get_task` / `list_tasks` from both the in-memory cache and disk.
- **Submission API**: `submit` immediately returns `task_id`, and the `_run_task` wrapped in `asyncio.create_task` runs the main body. Synchronous tool implementations are executed on a thread pool via `run_in_executor`. There is also `submit_async` for asynchronous tools. Upon completion, any `on_complete` callback is invoked via `await` (exceptions within the callback are logged and do not affect the task result).
- **How target tools are determined** (`BackgroundTaskManager.from_profiles`, **later entries take priority**):
  1. `_DEFAULT_ELIGIBLE_TOOLS` (code default, schema name for Mode A. Examples: `generate_character_assets`, `generate_fullbody`, `generate_bustup`, `generate_icon`, `generate_chibi`, `generate_3d_model`, `generate_rigged_model`, `generate_animations`, `local_llm`, `run_command`, etc.)
  2. Among the `EXECUTION_PROFILE` of each module loaded via `load_execution_profiles(TOOL_MODULES)`, the entries with `background_eligible: true`. The key is in **`tool:subcmd`** format, and the value is `expected_seconds` (60 if not set)
  3. `background_task.eligible_tools` of `config.json` (each tool's `threshold_s` overwrites the value of the same map)
  `is_eligible(name)` only checks **whether the name is included in the map** (the value is retained as an approximate number of seconds and is not used for threshold comparison).
- **Via agent**: When `ToolHandler` dispatches an unregistered tool externally, if the name is in the above map, it is routed to `BackgroundTaskManager.submit` and immediately returns JSON containing `task_id`. Result confirmation is done with tools such as `check_background_task` / `list_background_tasks`.
- **Via CLI (`animaworks-tool submit`)**: Command-type tools are also registered in TaskStore as `task_type="command"`. `PendingTaskExecutor` retrieves the attempt from TaskStore, and BackgroundTaskManager executes it. The result status is also saved to `state/background_tasks/{task_id}.json` for compatibility and can be confirmed from the completion notification.
- **Cleanup**: `cleanup_old_tasks(max_age_hours=24)` deletes JSON files from `completed_at` that have exceeded the specified time via `completed` / `failed`, and files that have remained in `running` state for more than **48 hours** from `created_at` (orphans from process crashes, etc.). The retention time is specified by the caller via the argument `max_age_hours`; there is no configuration key.

The **`rotate_dm_logs`** of the same module archives lines older than `max_age_days` (default 7 days) from `shared/dm_logs/*.jsonl` by appending them to `{元ファイル名}.{YYYYMMDD}.archive.jsonl`, and rewrites the active file to contain only recent lines (to prevent DM history from growing too large).

### 4. Growth

Memories accumulate through daily activities:
- Daily integration episodes only new activity chunks while preserving original evidence.
- Changes to knowledge and procedures are made through explicit work or confirmed configuration. Automatic changes are disabled by default.
- Memory storage and search when needed remain. Weekly and monthly automatic organization and automatic skill learning are disabled by default.

## Elements That Shape You

You are composed of multiple files and directories:

| Category | Content | Details |
|---------|------|------|
| **Personality** | identity.md, character_sheet.md | Your character, speech style, and way of thinking |
| **Job Role** | injection.md, specialty_prompt.md | Work responsibilities, approach, and procedures |
| **Permissions and Configuration** | permissions.json, status.json | What you can do and how you operate |
| **Periodic Actions** | heartbeat.md, cron.md | What to check when, and what to execute when |
| **Memory** | episodes/, knowledge/, procedures/, skills/, shortterm/ | Past experiences, learnings, procedures, and abilities |
| **Work Status** | Regular task store, state/current_state.md、task_results/、background_tasks/ | Persistent tasks and attempts, current focus, records of outputs and command-type tools |

Refer to `reference/anatomy/anima-anatomy.md` for the detailed role of each file and modification rules.
Refer to `anatomy/memory-system.md` for how the memory system works.

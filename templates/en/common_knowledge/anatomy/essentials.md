## What is AnimaWorks

A framework for operating AI agents not as "tools" but as **autonomous personalities**.

- Each Anima has its own personality, memory, and judgment criteria
- Acts periodically on its own without human instruction (Heartbeat / Cron)
- Takes on roles within the organization and collaborates with other Anima and humans
- Learns from experience, accumulates memory, and grows

## The 5 Execution Paths — "When and How It Moves"

Anima operates through the following 5 paths. All except Chat start automatically.

| Path | When it runs | What it does | Who uses it |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Chat** | When a human sends a message | Conversational response | Human → Anima |
| **Inbox** | When a DM arrives from another Anima | Immediate response to organization messages | Anima → Anima |
| **Heartbeat** | Periodic automatic startup (default 30 minutes) | Observe → plan → reflect. **Does not execute** | Automatic |
| **Cron** | Schedule of cron.md (e.g., every morning at 9:00) | Executes fixed tasks at scheduled times | Automatic |
| **TaskExec** | When a regular task is executable and its dependencies are complete | Executes with saved inputs and retrieved LLM attempts | Registered via submit_tasks or delegate_task |

Chat and Heartbeat run on **separate locks**, so it can respond immediately to human conversation even while on patrol.

## Heartbeat vs Cron — Two Autonomous Actions

Both are mechanisms that "run without human instruction," but their purposes are fundamentally different.

| Perspective | Heartbeat (periodic patrol) | Cron (scheduled task) |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Analogy** | A security guard who patrols the office periodically | A newspaper delivery that arrives every morning at 9 |
| **Purpose** | Situation check, planning, reflection | Execution of assigned work |
| **Does it execute?** | **No**. If it finds a task, it only submits it via `submit_tasks` or `delegate_task` | **Yes**. LLM type thinks and executes; Command type executes immediately |
| **Interval** | Fixed interval (default 30 minutes, varies with Activity Level) | Flexibly specified in cron format (every day at 9:00, every Friday at 17:00, etc.) |
| **Configuration file** | `heartbeat.md` (checklist) | `cron.md` (task definition) |
| **Typical examples** | Checking unread messages, detecting blockers, reviewing progress | Morning work planning, weekly reports, running backups |

**If unsure**: "Just check and decide" → add to the Heartbeat checklist. "Do something at a fixed time" → define as a Cron task.

## Two Types of Cron — LLM type vs Command type

Cron tasks come in two types depending on whether thinking is required.

| Perspective | LLM type (`type: llm`) | Command type (`type: command`) |
|------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **Analogy** | "Think about what should be prioritized today" | "Press this button every morning" |
| **Judgment** | Yes (output varies depending on the situation) | No (executes the same thing every time) |
| **API cost** | Yes (LLM call) | The command itself has none. However, **a follow-up LLM may start in some cases** (see below) |
| **Output** | Unstructured (varies by task) | Deterministic (command stdout) |
| **Suitable tasks** | Planning, reflection, writing, memory organization | Backups, sending notifications, data retrieval, health checks |

### Follow-up LLM for Command type (Important)

The Command type executes the command itself mechanically, but **if stdout has a return value, the LLM starts by default to analyze the result** (follow-up). In other words, it may not be completely zero-cost.

```
コマンド実行 → stdout あり？
  → なし → 終了（LLM 不要）
  → あり → skip_pattern にマッチする？
      → マッチ → 終了（LLM スキップ）
      → マッチしない → LLM が起動して結果を解釈・対処判断
```

Options to control this follow-up:
- **`trigger_heartbeat: false`** — Always skip the follow-up LLM (when result analysis is unnecessary)
- **`skip_pattern: <正規表現>`** — Skip only when stdout matches (ignore only in normal cases; let the LLM judge in abnormal cases)

### Criteria for choosing between them

```
「毎回同じことをするだけ？」
  → はい、結果も見なくてよい → Command型 + trigger_heartbeat: false
  → はい、ただし異常時だけ判断が必要 → Command型 + skip_pattern（正常パターン）
  → いいえ（状況に応じて判断が変わる） → LLM型
  → コマンド実行 + 毎回結果の解釈が必要 → LLM型（description にコマンド実行を指示）
```

### Example descriptions

```markdown
## 毎朝の業務計画（LLM型）
schedule: 0 9 * * *
type: llm
episodes/ から昨日の進捗を確認し、今日のタスクを計画する。

## バックアップ実行（Command型・follow-up不要）
schedule: 0 2 * * *
type: command
trigger_heartbeat: false
command: /usr/local/bin/backup.sh

## 監視チェック（Command型・正常時はスキップ、異常時はLLMが判断）
schedule: */15 * * * *
type: command
skip_pattern: ^OK$
command: /usr/local/bin/health-check.sh
```

## How to Flow Tasks — submit_tasks vs delegate_task

There are two ways to put tasks into execution.

| Perspective | `submit_tasks` | `delegate_task` |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Who executes** | **Your own** TaskExec path | **Direct subordinates** |
| **When to use** | When you want to asynchronously execute tasks you should do yourself | When you want to delegate to subordinates |
| **DAG/parallel** | Parallel via `parallel: true`, dependencies via `depends_on` | Delegate one at a time |
| **Progress tracking** | `list_tasks` / TaskBoard referencing the regular task store | Track via `task_tracker` |
| **Typical examples** | Executing tasks found in Heartbeat yourself | A supervisor delegating work to subordinates |

**Decision flow**:
```
「このタスクは部下がやるべき？」
  → はい、直属の部下がいる → delegate_task
  → いいえ、自分でやる → submit_tasks
  → 部下がいない → submit_tasks
```

## Team Design — Start Solo and Scale

### Why split roles

| Reason | Explanation |
|------|------|
| Prevent context pollution | Having one person handle all steps causes context bloat and degrades judgment accuracy |
| Structural quality assurance | Separate the executor from the validator (eliminate blind spots in self-review) |
| Parallel execution | Independent roles run concurrently to improve throughput |
| Deeper specialization | Role-specific checklists and memory produce higher quality than general-purpose agents |

### Scaling stages

| Scale | Structure | When to use |
|------|------|---------|
| **Solo** | 1 Anima covers all roles | Small tasks, prototypes, just starting out |
| **Pair** | PdM + Engineer | Medium-sized routine tasks |
| **Full team** | PdM + Engineer + Reviewer + Tester | Full-fledged projects |
| **Scaled** | PdM + multiple Engineers + multiple Reviewers + Tester | Large-scale, multi-module work |

### Guidelines for judgment

- High cost of failure → increase role separation
- "The implementer is reviewing their own work" → separate the Reviewer
- Many modules that can be worked on in parallel → increase Engineers

## Memory — Using the 5 Types Properly

| Memory type | Directory | In one word | Example |
|-----------|------------|--------|-----|
| **Episodic memory** | `episodes/` | What was done and when | "Researched the Slack API on 3/15" |
| **Semantic memory** | `knowledge/` | What was learned | "The Slack API rate limit is 100 times/minute" |
| **Procedural memory** | `procedures/` | How to do it | "Gmail authentication setup procedure" |
| **Skills** | `skills/` | Executable procedure documentation | Image generation skill, research skill |
| **Short-term memory** | `shortterm/` | Recent context | The flow of the current conversation |

**Priming (automatic recall)** automatically recalls relevant memories during each conversation or patrol and injects the necessary context into the system prompt. Additionally, you can actively search via `search_memory`.

**Consolidation** only episodicizes new activity chunks and does not generate them for re-executions with no changes. Automatic knowledge changes, weekly/monthly organization, and automatic skill learning are disabled by default. Memory storage and search when needed remain available.

## Cost Optimization — background_model and Activity Level

### background_model

Heartbeat / Cron can use an explicitly configured background_model. Inbox uses the main model, and task-specific model specifications take priority for that task. Do not auto-select simply because it is cheaper.

| Category | Model used | Target |
|------|-----------|------|
| foreground | Main model, or an explicitly specified task-specific model | Chat, Inbox, TaskExec |
| background | Explicitly configured background_model; if not set, the main model | Heartbeat, Cron |

Configuration: `animaworks anima set-background-model {名前} claude-sonnet-4-6`

### Activity Level

The overall activity frequency can be adjusted from 10% to 400%. It directly affects the Heartbeat interval.

| Activity Level | Heartbeat interval (with 30-minute base) | Use case |
|---------------|-------------------------------|------|
| 200% | 15 minutes | Busy periods, active development |
| 100% (default) | 30 minutes | Normal operation |
| 50% | 60 minutes | Low load, cost savings |
| 30% | 100 minutes | Nighttime, holidays |

**Activity Schedule** also allows automatic switching by time period (e.g., 100% from 9:00-22:00, 30% from 22:00-6:00).

## Organization Basics — Supervisors, Subordinates, Colleagues

Anima's hierarchy is determined by the `supervisor` field in `status.json`.

| Relationship | Definition | Communication |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Supervisor** | Anima specified in `supervisor` | Progress reports (MUST), issue escalation |
| **Subordinate** | Anima whose `supervisor` is you | Delegate via `delegate_task`, monitor via `org_dashboard` |
| **Colleague** | Anima with the same `supervisor` | Direct contact OK |
| **Other department** | None of the above | Via your supervisor (direct contact is generally prohibited) |
| **Human** | When `supervisor: null` (top level) | Notify via `call_human` |

## First Steps When Stuck

| Situation | What to do |
|------|---------|
| Don't know how to operate | `search_memory(query="キーワード", scope="common_knowledge")` |
| Task is blocked | Refer to `troubleshooting/escalation-flowchart.md` |
| Tool is not working | Refer to `troubleshooting/common-issues.md` |
| Don't know what to do | Check current_state.md and `list_tasks`. If needed, refer to the configured Heartbeat checklist |
| Unsure how to decide | Consult your supervisor via `send_message(intent="question")` |

# Memory Consolidation and Forgetting

Memory consolidation consists of judgment by Anima and candidate collection and index maintenance performed by the framework. The timing is configurable, with the default daily consolidation at 02:00 and weekly consolidation on Sunday at 03:00. Weekly consolidation runs when `weekly_enabled` is enabled.

## Daily Processing

`core/supervisor/_mgr_scheduler.py` registers the daily job, and `core/lifecycle/system_consolidation.py`'s `_handle_daily_consolidation` selects the target Anima. Execution may be skipped based on inactivity periods or the number of records in the last 24 hours.

Anima's `run_consolidation` summarizes the previous day's activity log into dated episodes and extracts atomic facts from the summaries. Subsequent framework post-processing proceeds in the following order:

1. `ForgettingEngine.synaptic_downscaling` marks low-activity candidates on the index.
2. `knowledge_self_correction` reviews the relevant knowledge and procedures with an LLM and creates procedures from resolved issues.

This correction runs while `core/lifecycle/knowledge_correction.py` manages the upper limit. Detailed reconsolidation conditions are described later.

## Weekly Processing

The weekly Anima cycle is handled by `core/anima/lifecycle.py`'s `_run_weekly_consolidation`. `ConsolidationEngine` prepares merges, conflicts between facts, and forgetting candidates, while `hygiene.py` compiles a report of knowledge file format and size check candidates. These are included in the weekly prompt, and Anima judges the content to update and archive memory files. The hygiene scan itself does not move or delete memory files.

After weekly processing, `ProceduralDistiller.weekly_pattern_distill` distills recurring patterns from activity logs into procedure candidates. Additionally, if `skill_autolearn_enabled` is enabled, eligible procedures are used to create low-risk probation skills.

## Forgetting Candidates and Thresholds

`core/memory/maintenance/forgetting.py`'s daily downscaling marks regular knowledge and episodes as low-activity if more than 90 days have passed since last use and usage count is fewer than 3. Procedures use a different criterion: they are marked as low-activity if unused for more than 180 days with total usage below 3, or if there are 3 or more failures and utility is below 0.3. Protected or reused memories are excluded from consideration.

Weekly forgetting candidates include memories that have been in a low-activity state for more than 90 days with usage count of 2 or fewer. This is not a deletion command but a candidate list for Anima to decide whether to retain based on the content and surrounding context. Candidate presentation scope and protection rule implementation are handled by `ForgettingEngine`.

## Procedure Usage Tracking and Reconsolidation

After using a procedure, `report_procedure_outcome` records success or failure. The results are used to update `success_count`, `failure_count`, and `confidence` in the frontmatter.

`core/memory/maintenance/reconsolidation.py` marks a procedure as a reconsolidation candidate if it meets `failure_count >= 1` **or** `confidence < 0.6`. When the LLM revises it, the old version is archived, `version` is advanced, and the success and failure counters and confidence are reset to initial values.

## Periodic RAG Index Updates

RAG index updates follow a single schedule separate from weekly consolidation. `core/supervisor/_mgr_scheduler.py`'s daily indexing job runs by default at 04:00, reflecting memory files, facts, and shared data, and also updates the BM25 and entity indexes. There is no separate path where weekly post-processing rebuilds the entire RAG. For index and recovery paths, see [Intentional Recall and Search](retrieval.md).

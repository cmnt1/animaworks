# Messaging

Messages between Anima instances are delivered to their destination via `send_message`. `intent` is metadata indicating the purpose of a message and is not used to filter Inbox startup. Conversation history is read primarily from activity logs, supplemented by DM history depending on shared configuration.

## Shared channels and company boundaries

`post_channel` posts to shared channels, and `read_channel` reads recent accessible posts. Channel metadata manages members, closed status, and company scope. An open channel with a specified company is limited to visibility from Anima instances within that company. The send paths for DMs and channels, as well as alias resolution for external destinations, are handled by `core/messaging/`.

## Send rules and receive dispatch

`send_message` uses the `report` / `question` intents and rejects a second message to the same destination within the same run. There is no limit on the number of destinations. `post_channel` can post to the same channel at most once per run, but there is no cooldown between runs. There is also no time- or day-based send budget and no send refusal based on conversation depth. `Messenger.send` records messages in the activity log and, when depth is recorded in the diagnostic log, does not refuse delivery.

On the receive side, `core/runtime/inbox_rate_limiter.py` monitors file change notifications in the Inbox JSON and starts the Inbox lane if there are unread messages. Concurrency is limited to one; messages that arrive while a run is in progress are batched into the next run. To guard against missed notifications, it rechecks every 45 seconds, and on Provider errors it retains unread messages while waiting for `rate_guard`'s recovery time. `overflow_inbox` remains as capacity protection.

## Notifications to humans and external integrations

`call_human` is the path for sending notifications and confirmation requests to humans. There is a mode that requires a per-session confirmation key, which is confirmed using the key issued at runtime. See the [CLI reference](../reference/tool-cli.md) for CLI / tool usage.

External message sending supports configured Slack, Chatwork, and Discord destinations, while Zoom is used for meeting audio integration. See the [integration guide](../integrations/index.md) for channel configuration and individual integration procedures.

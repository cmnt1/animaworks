# Model Execution

Resolve the execution mode from the model name and per-anima configuration, then pass it to the SDK, CLI, or API call for each engine. S, C, X, D, and G use dedicated engines, while A runs API models through LiteLLM.

## Execution Modes

| Mode | Primary model name patterns | Engine | Authentication | Tool execution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S | `claude-*` | Claude Agent SDK | Claude subscription, API key, or Bedrock or Vertex AI authentication | Uses the SDK's built-in features and MCP, connecting to AnimaWorks' tool handler. |
| C | `codex/*`, `openai-codex/*` | Codex SDK / CLI | Codex CLI login information or configured provider credentials | Uses Codex's execution features, converting to common events and tool records. |
| X | `grok/*` | Grok Build CLI | Grok CLI authentication | Standardizes events and execution results via the CLI's ACP stream. |
| D | `cursor/*` | Cursor Agent CLI | Cursor CLI login information | Uses the CLI's session and tool execution. |
| G | `gemini/*` | Gemini CLI | Google-side CLI authentication | Treats CLI execution results as common events. |
| A | `openai/*`, `azure/*`, `bedrock/*`, `google/*`, `vertex_ai/*`, etc. | LiteLLM loop | Provider API key or cloud credentials | Executes LiteLLM's function/tool call via AnimaWorks' handler. |

The resolution order from the model name is: explicit per-anima specification in `status.json`, model-specific fallback in `models.json` and `config.json`, and the default pattern in `core/config/model_mode.py`. Models that match none of these resolve to A. See the [configuration reference](../reference/config.md) for individual configuration items.

## Common Execution Layer and Failure Behavior

Implementations for each engine are placed in `core/execution/engines/`. The common layer's `core/execution/events.py`, `session_store.py`, `process_runner.py`, `watchdog.py`, `tool_evidence.py`, and `cli_stream.py` standardize events, session persistence, process control, and tool evidence. Error classification, process termination, binary search, `clear_session`, and response/error determination are also handled in the intermediate layer. D and G are included in this structure.

The watchdog determines idle status when no engine event arrives for 1200 seconds. This is not a timeout measuring total execution time. Rate limit and provider overload information is shared per provider family in `llm_rate_guard`, preventing other Anima instances from making consecutive requests to the same provider. This guard is designed so that read/write failures do not stop normal execution.

In addition to the primary model, `fallback_model` or `fallback_models` can be specified. Based on classification results for authentication, rate limits, etc., and fallback settings, the system switches to the next candidate. For heartbeat and cron, `background_model`, `background_credential`, and `background_thinking_effort` can be specified.

## Context Management

Context compression methods differ by engine. S saves a baseline amount of conversation to track changes, using the SDK's compression features and idle-time compression. C discards the current thread at a threshold and starts a new thread. X and D record the number of resume turns, rotating sessions every 10 turns. A summarizes the conversation when approaching input limits or on overflow, then retries with shortened history. G follows the dedicated CLI's session behavior and does not perform common session persistence with turn limits.

The default per-anima context threshold is 0.50, and the absolute ceiling is 0.75. The default compaction token threshold for task execution is 0, with a default maximum count of 6. Model-specific compaction thresholds can also be specified in `models.json`.

## Design Decisions

- **Do not build a custom agent loop.** Let the engine (Claude Agent SDK, Codex, each CLI, LiteLLM) handle tool-use iteration; AnimaWorks only handles the common processing around it (prompt assembly, permissions, sessions, error classification, and logging).
